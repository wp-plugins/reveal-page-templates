Adds a column to the Edit Pages Dashboard screen displaying the Page Template assigned to each Page.



== Description==

This plugin adds a column to the Edit Pages screen in the Dashboard which displays the Page Template filename assigned to each Page. This gives you an at-a-glance overview of the Page Templates assigned to Pages, without having to open each Page to find out. The new column is sortable too!

This is a very simple plugin. Just install, activate and forget about it.

Either use the WordPress Plugin Installer (Dashboard > Plugins > Add New, then search for "custom taxonomies menu widget"), or manually as follows:

1. Download the latest version of the plugin to your computer.
2. Extract and upload the folder *reveal-page-templates* to your */wp-content/plugins/* directory. Please ensure that you do not rename any folder or filenames in the process.
3. Activate the plugin in your Dashboard via the "Plugins" menu.

Note for Wordpress Multisite users:

* Install the plugin in your */plugins/* directory (do not install in the */mu-plugins/* directory).
* In order for this plugin to be visible to blog owners, the plugin has to be activated for each blog by the Site Administrator.
